# TailwindCSS Install Script

Script is completely written by me (sergithewinner) with little help of guides and documentations.

### Installation

This Script Tested & Worked Under [Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/)

Please clone repo on Desktop or somewhere else than work folder to make backup files
(after installation there will be two folders one Desktop & one Work Folder)

After cloning repo, open bash terminal & run script:

```sh
$ bash setup.sh
```
